# Cookie Policy

Effective Date: October 20 2025 snurftech.com 

I use cookies and other similar tracking technologies on my website, [https://snurftech.com](https://snurftech.com).

This policy explains what cookies are, how I use them, and your choices regarding their use.

## What Are Cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile) when you visit a website. Websites also use other similar technologies, like localStorage, to store data directly in your browser. Cookies and these other technologies are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide reporting information.

Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies.
- Session cookies expire when you close your browser.
- Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them.

## How I Use Cookies

I use cookies for two primary purposes:

### Strictly Necessary Cookies (Essential)

These cookies are required for the website to function properly and securely. They enable core functionality such as page navigation, accessing secure areas of the website, remembering your cookie consent preferences, and loading content quickly. The website cannot function correctly without these cookies.

I do not require your consent for these cookies.

### Analytics/Performance Cookies (Google Analytics 4 - GA4)

These cookies help me measure and analyze how visitors interact with my website, which in turn helps me understand and improve its performance. They collect information such as the number of visitors, which pages are most popular, and how users navigate the site. This data is aggregated and, in most cases, anonymized.

I use Google Analytics (GA4) for this purpose. The data collected helps me:

- Track website traffic and user behavior.

- Measure the success of content.

- Improve the user experience.

I require your explicit consent to use these cookies.

## The Cookies I Use

Below is a breakdown of the specific cookies I use:

| Type	| Name | Provider | Purpose | Storage Method | Duration |
|:------|:-----|:---------|:--------|:---------------|:---------|
| Strictly Necessary | klaro | snurftech.com | Stores your cookie consent preferences. | Cookie | 30 days |

> The exact names and number of cookies may change over time. I strive to keep this list current.

## Third-Party Cookies

Some of the cookies on my website are set by third parties. For example, the analytics cookies used by Google (GA4) are considered third-party cookies. These parties may be able to recognize your device when it visits my website and also when it visits certain other websites.

For more information on how Google uses data collected through GA4, please review [Googleâ€™s Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

## Your Choices and Consent Management

Under data protection laws like the GDPR, I must obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before setting any non-essential cookies (like Analytics cookies).

### Cookie Settings

When you first visit my site, you are presented with a cookie banner that allows you to:

- Accept all (including Necessary and Analytics cookies).

- Reject non-essential (which only allows Necessary cookies).

- Manage Preferences (to individually enable or disable categories like Analytics).

You can change or withdraw your consent at any time by clicking on the button that looks like a cookie with a bite taken out of it, which is permanently available in bottom-right corner of my website.

### Browser Settings

You can manage cookies through your web browser settings. Most browsers allow you to:

- View which cookies you have and delete them individually.

- Block third-party cookies.

- Block cookies from particular sites.

- Block all cookies from being set.

Blocking all cookies may impact the functionality of many websites, including mine, as strictly necessary cookies will also be affected.
